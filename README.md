# Wireless-Sensor-Network-
A Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) consists of multiple sensor nodes that sense environmental parameters and transmit the data wirelessly to a sink node (base station).

# ---- Objective ---- #

# To understand the basic architecture of a Wireless Sensor Network
# To interface sensors with sensor nodes
# To enable wireless communication between nodes
# To collect and observe real-time sensor data at a base station


# ---- Requirements ---- #

# Sensor nodes (ESP32 / Arduino + RF module / NodeMCU)
# Sensors (Temperature, Humidity, Light, etc.)
# Wireless communication module (Wi-Fi / Zigbee / LoRa / NRF24L01)
# Power supply (battery / USB)
# Base station (PC / Mobile / Cloud dashboard)
# Arduino IDE / PlatformIO
